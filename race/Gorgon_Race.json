							"Gorgons are seen rarely through out the many planes but are seen less rarely in Theros. They were created by the Goddess Pharika whom they refer to as mother creator. Gorgon devout communites tend to seclude and isolate far away from the other races of Theors. Many Gorgons are shaped by a rough upbringing in the wasteland like lands of Ravnica. They are born along with their siblings in a clutch of soft shelled eggs. Once each clutch reaches 5 years old they are brought to ravnica and the siblings of that clutch are placed seperately among the Devout communities. Gorgon children are male and female, however all children are rendered sterile by Pharika before they are placed on the ravnica plane. Some Gorgons follow Pharika their mother faithfully, while others reject her after struggling through the absence of a loving mother. Gorgon Children Gorgons have male and female among their them but all females are rendererd sterile by Pharika. While some of Pharika's gorgon children look to her coldness as a test of their love and resilience, outcasted and defectors feel that they were simple creations she made with no  attachment to be used and discarded much like tools or playthings. The Gorgon's that leave the Devout communities tend to be loners simply because of their appearance and infamous reputation as unfeeling, dark, and deadly creatures petrifying everyone in sight. Even though many people would be right that they are deadly, and can petrify people they are hardly unfeeling. They are simply, more dangerous because of how much they feel. Many outcasted are angry and hurt by the abandonment of their mother Pharika and sister and brother gorgons. Many Gorgon children ponder as to who their fathers are as Pharika has had multiple partners through the eons. Medusae who are devout often serve as doctors, herbalists, advisors, assassins, and poisoners. Medusae who are defected or outcasted may be more inclined to choose a different class as a way of rebelling further against Pharika. A good example is becoming a paladin Oath of glory (Demigod) and choose to serve a different and often opposing god (Like Kruphix or Keranos). The Devout Communities, Outcasted, and Defectors. There are a total of of 30 devout communities with 25 to 50 medusae in each community. Many Medusae Look very varied from each other and come in many colors from black, brown, tan, monochrome, rainbow and anywhere in between. Many Children of Medusae believe this is partially possible if their mother Pharika had different mates from time to time. The only thing that all Medusae children seem to have in common is their tendrils of snakes they lovingly refer to as their diadems. Medusae are extremely proud of their snakes and painstakingly take care of them making sure their spines do not break as they are very fragile.  All medusae have hard scaled bodies and tend to range in weight from 150 lbs to 300 lbs. Even when small, Medusae tend to be strong and lithe. The commonly make Good Fighters and paladins as a result of their strength but not all follow the path of most resistance and are very versatile in their profession (Class) choices. The devout children often have ranking in their communities. The strongest are normally picked by Pharika to be the community leaders. Leaders keep the community in check and make sure that any orders from Pharika are followed whether it is poison experiments or helping Pharika to thwart Kruphix's Oracles. In these communities there is strict guidelines to follow the teachings and beliefs of their Mother Pharika. If the guidelines are not fully followed then in the harshest punishment of deviation a Medusae's Diadem be cut off or the rendering him or her unable to use their bane (Poison) any longer. At which point they are then outcasted from the group left in a barren wasteland to fend for themselves. Devout occasionally leave the Devout communities when ordained to do so for special missions given by Pharika. The defectors are more commonly Medusae who have escaped the tight grip of their communities and have chosen to venture forth into the world in search of a new life. Once a defector has left they cannot come back to the community or they risk losing their diadems. In these cases defectors tend to often conceal their Diadems and identities from many of the people they meet as an assurance of their own safety, it's not uncommon for them to disguise themselves as creatures that also bare scales on their skin like Dragonborn, Kobolds, or tritons if they are trying to blend in a city. Medusae names Gorgons take on the first four letters of the God they serve as their last name. For example if you follow Pharika then your last name would be Phar, or if you follow Iroas then your last name would be Iroa. If they server no god then they take on the last name that symbolizes their beliefs, or holds special meaning. Female Gorgon Name examples: (Nostra, Sthasos, Mira, Hunura, Hosta, Zovaste, Konica, Phaktule, Kestia, Virsodya, Phasta, Hyzadara, Hellete, Zeso, Zalidaria, Zaxea, etc.) Male Gorgon Name examples:( Phusdetus, Phalagos, Nevantos, Zandris, Dumarus, Stheusos, Thazo, Thulotos, Vyrion, Hadotus, Kandrotese, Chronor, Virerus, Hednys, Kenanos, etc.)"

In the Gray areas Medusae may side themselves with any other god or no god. And in cases of extreme devotion they commonly become Champions and servants to Pharika herself or to the Goddess Nylea."

						"You are a child of Pharika, and do not know who you father is. It's become apparent however that all the clutches have different colors and abilities. It is likely Pharika has had many different partners. Your specie type chooses your scale color and damage type. The Essirius have scales in earthy colors such as whites, creams, tans, browns, and blacks and come in either one color or multiple earthtones creating intricate patterns. This species is most known for it's strength and constitution making them great warriors. The Iridion species is always one color but it has an irridescent rainbow shine over the scales. This species is noted for it's wisdom and charisma but it's also feared due to it's necrotic damage type. Arveniom is the most colorful species with scales, ranging from average colors to neon. This species also has a variety of patterns from solid color to elbaroate diamonds. They are remembered especially by underground organizations because of their intelligence and Dexterity, making them good candidates for heists or unsavory jobs. The Vunaicon species often has metallic scales, they are more commonly just one color, but when they do have patterns their stripes, diamonds, and spots may come in white brown or some other non mettallic color while the bulk of their scales are in a mettalic shade."
