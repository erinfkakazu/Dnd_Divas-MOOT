						"Gorgons are seen rarely through out the many planes but are seen less rarely in Theros. They were created by the Goddess Pharika whom they refer to as mother creator. Gorgon devout communites tend to seclude and isolate far away from the other races of Theors. Many Gorgons are shaped by a rough upbringing in the wasteland like lands of Ravnica. They are born along with their siblings in a clutch of soft shelled eggs. Once each clutch reaches 5 years old they are brought to ravnica and the siblings of that clutch are placed seperately among the Devout communities. Gorgon children are male and female, however all children are rendered sterile by Pharika before they are placed on the ravnica plane. Some Gorgons follow Pharika their mother faithfully, while others reject her after struggling through the absence of a loving mother."

								"Many outcasted are angry and hurt by the abandonment of their mother Pharika and sister and brother gorgons. Gorgons who become branded as outcasted become so for one of the following reasons (Or something in this vein.). One; Outright defiance towards pharika and her ideals. Tow; Destroying alchemical, medical, phtathalogical, or similar research. Three; Performing a notable act of healing withut exacting a significant price. Four; Slaying a Devout Gorgon or Serpent. Once branded an Outcasted they cannot come back, if they try, they risk execution. The defectors are Gorgons who have either escaped before punishment, or who have chosen to venture forth into the world in search of a life more suited to them then that of the Devout communities. Once a defector has left they cannot come back to the community or they risk losing their diadems. In these cases defectors tend to often conceal their Diadems and identities from many of the people they meet as an assurance of their own safety, it's not uncommon for them to disguise themselves as creatures that also bare scales on their skin like Dragonborn, Kobolds, or tritons if they are trying to blend in a city. Devout and Outcasted Gorgons may sometimes choose to reject the gods outright as a result of understanding how little the gods care if what you are or do does not benefit them. They may also choose to serve a god that opposes Pharika in vengeful defiance. Or they may choose they do not want to live the life of a Devout Gorgon, but still want to pay tribute to pharika and may choose to follow Nylea who Pharika cherishes. Opposing gods of Pharika are Keranos and Kruphix"
